# godot-visual-novel-template
This is a Godot project that can be used as a template for making visual novels. It's similar to Ren'Py, but it's not aiming to be a feature-complete recreation of it or any other engine.
Dialogue and events can be read in from text files or added as functions in the main scene script.

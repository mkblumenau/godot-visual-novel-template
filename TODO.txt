	Input box
		For strings only

To add:
	Maybe make the audio in a global variables?
		This would avoid duplicating some code between main_menu and AudioSources
	Add features to runSceneFromFile
		Warning: If you call a dialogue menu at the end of a string of dialogue, and you take it to another menu, sceneFromFileDone will still be called for the end of the first scene. The game will not await it again on subsequent scenes, so be careful what you put after calling runSceneFromFile.
	Save system?
		Not yet; this is dependent on what type of game is made in this framework/engine
	Make it so "Return to main menu" asks if you're sure you want to return?
		Also quit game button in menu?
	Back button?
		Requires a "stack" of actions that are evaluated
	Choice menu- make it so you can go to the menu using focus from there?
